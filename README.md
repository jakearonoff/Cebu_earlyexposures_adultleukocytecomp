# Cebu_earlyexposures_adultleukocytecomp
This covers my bioinformatics pipeline for a paper in prep that explores early life influences (adversity/stress, nutrition, microbial) on immune cell composition (estimated from DNA methylation) later in adulthood among the CLHNS birth cohort members. 

I learned much of the quality control steps I present here while attending the "Genomics for Social Scientists - Epigenetics" workshop, hosted by the Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, at the University of Michigan. This course was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - National Institute on Aging (NIA) R25 AG 053227
