# Cebu_earlyexposures_adultleukocytecomp
This covers my analysis exploring early life influences (adversity/stress, nutrition, microbial) on immune cell composition later in adulthood among the CLHNS birth cohort members. I estimated cell proportions (CD4T, CD8T, B cell, NK, monocytes, granulocytes) using DNA methylation data. 

I learned much of the quality control steps I present here while attending the "Genomics for Social Scientists - Epigenetics" workshop, hosted by the Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research, at the University of Michigan. This course was supported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - National Institute on Aging (NIA) R25 AG 053227
